Questions:

1. List all possible plays for the board 5♠ 4♥ 2♦ 6♣ A♠ J♥ K♦ 5♣ 2♠

 5 spades - 6 clubs
 5 clubs - 6 clubs

2. If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, and K? Why or why not?

 Yes, because all A-10 cards are taken away in pairs so if the remaining cards included an A-10
 there would have to be an even number remaining.

3. Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter
which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer. 

No, there is no strategy, when there are multiple plays, it doesn't matter which you choose.

First, imagine that there is only one suit.  Then every card would belong to
exactly one group (A-10 to pairs, J-Q-K to their own group).  Suppose that
two groups are on the board and you can choose between them.  No matter which
you choose, the other group will still be there, and the cards in the remaining
group cannot be combined with any of the new cards to form a new group.  So it 
doesn't matter the order you remove them, you'll always be able to remove both
groups and no better choice could come along.  

Now, when you make it four suits, you might have a choice of which suit to
remove, but it doesn't matter because cards of different suit and the same
point value are exactly equivalent, it doesn't matter which you remove, it's
exactly the same as if you had removed the other.
