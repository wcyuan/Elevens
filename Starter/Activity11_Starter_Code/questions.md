1. Set the I_AM_DEBUGGING flags to false and GAMES_TO_PLAY to 10. Run the
ElevensSimulation program a few times and record the percentage of games won for each run.

 What is the range of win percentages that you saw? 

 0% to 30%

 Were the percentages fairly consistent, or did they vary quite a bit?

 Varied

2. Increase the number of games to play to 100. Are the win percentages more consistent from run
to run?

 Yes, between about 7% and 15%

3. Experiment with simulating different numbers of games. How many games do you need to play in
order to get consistent results from run to run?

 1000 games gives a range from about 9% to 12%, which is pretty good.

4. Optional â€” Repeat the above steps for the Thirteens game.

 For 10 games at a time:

 What is the range of win percentages that you saw? 


 Were the percentages fairly consistent, or did they vary quite a bit?


 For 10 games at a time:

 40% to 80%, pretty varied

 For 100 games at a time:

 53% to 73%

 How many games do you need to play in order to get consistent results from run to run?

 500 games gives a range from about 59% to 64%
